# Test task
Here is a draft task.

To start it locally:

run `python migration.py`

it will create sqlite database file and populate it with data from attached CSV file
Then you could start a web server by running `python main.py`

And the last you could open `index.html` in your browser

There are also basic backend tests. To run them just type
 `pytest tests/tests.py`
